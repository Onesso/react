# How to upload a react web application to github pages

Here is the youtube video for reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtODigNB6Is

# step 1.
Create a new repo.

# step 2.
clone your repo to your local machine

# step 3.
create a react app on same directory i.e npx create-react-app tutorial

# step 4.
Move the react files to the root directory.
You can archive this by deleting the node modules cut everything that is in the tutorial directory and past them in the root dir.
npm install to return the node modules.

# step 5.
Add homepage to package.json i.e "homepage":"https://onesso/github.io/tutorial",

# step 6.
Install github pages package i.e npm i gh-pages

# step 7
Add deploy scripts to packages.json i.e.       "predeploy": "npm run build",
                                                "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
this is written on the script section.

# step 8.
push the code to github repo

# step 9.
Deploy the code i.e. npm run deploy

# step 10.
Test the github link






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
